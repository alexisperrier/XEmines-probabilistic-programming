* Conjugate prior
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior
the likelihood is viewed as an operator transforming the prior distribution into the posterior distribution
paper: Conjugate Bayesian analysis of the Gaussian distribution

* “ recommendations of Gelman, McElreath, Kruschke
we will prefer weakly informative priors.”Excerpt From: Osvaldo Martin. “Bayesian Analysis with Python.”

* Exercice: generate different distributions in python and visualize, use different libraries, including pymc3.
